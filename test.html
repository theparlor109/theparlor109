            Dennis cut both of my 4 year old boys hair and for one of the first times they sat in the chair alone
            and didn’t complain or anything! Kenny was warm and accommodating when we walked in and
            made sure we had something to drink and put something on tv for the kids. It was a great
            experience and their haircut was exactly what I was looking for. It’s nice to see people doing
            something for our community and trying to get everyone involved!<br>

          Dominick loves getting his hair cut by Lucas !!! Lucas is very patient with the children and
          extremely friendly. He never rushes and always listens when Dominick interrupts him
          lol. Thanks for cleaning up my handsome little man <br>

          I found this barber on Instagram I took a chance to have someone cut my son hair I’m very picky! I used to
          take my son all the way to Yonkers, NY just to get a haircut. I’m so happy I took a chance because I
          love it! I chose Lucas he has so much patience with my son.. He is the man with a fresh cut he listen to
          details on how you want the haircut. I definitely recommend Lucas if you’re a picky mom!<br>
